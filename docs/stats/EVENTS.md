```

### Event Handler Pattern
```c
combat_player_kill local.attacker local.victim local.inflictor local.hitloc local.mod:
    // Get player GUIDs for tracking
    local.attacker_guid = local.attacker getclientinfo "guid"
    local.victim_guid = local.victim getclientinfo "guid"
    
    // Get positions for heatmap
    local.attacker_pos = local.attacker.origin
    local.victim_pos = local.victim.origin
    
    // Format data for API
    local.data = "event=player_kill"
    local.data += "&attacker_guid=" + local.attacker_guid
    local.data += "&victim_guid=" + local.victim_guid
    local.data += "&weapon=" + local.inflictor
    local.data += "&hitloc=" + local.hitloc
    local.data += "&mod=" + local.mod
    local.data += "&attacker_x=" + local.attacker_pos[0]
    local.data += "&attacker_y=" + local.attacker_pos[1]
    local.data += "&victim_x=" + local.victim_pos[0]
    local.data += "&victim_y=" + local.victim_pos[1]
    local.data += "&timestamp=" + level.time
    
    // Send to API
    curl_post "http://localhost:8080/api/v1/ingest/events" local.data "tracker.scr::http_callback"
end
```

### Available Engine Commands
```c
event_subscribe "event_name" "handler_label"   // Subscribe to event
registercmd "command" "handler_label"          // Register console command
curl_get "url" "callback_label"                // HTTP GET request
curl_post "url" "data" "callback_label"        // HTTP POST request
